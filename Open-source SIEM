Top ten list of Open source SIEM 
what is a SIEM?
Security information and event management, SIEM for short, is a solution that helps organizations detect,
analyze, and respond to security threats before they harm business operations.
SIEM, pronounced “sim,” combines both security information management (SIM)
and security event management (SEM) into one security management system.
SIEM technology collects event log data from a range of sources, identifies 
activity that deviates from the norm with real-time analysis, and takes appropriate action.
In short, SIEM gives organizations visibility into activity within their network
so they can respond swiftly to potential cyberattacks and meet compliance requirements.
In the past decade, SIEM technology has evolved to make threat detection 
and incident response smarter and faster with artificial intelligence.

Benefits of SIEM 
SIEM tools offer many benefits that can help strengthen an organization’s overall security posture, including:

• A central view of potential threats
• Real-time threat identification and response
• Advanced threat intelligence
• Regulatory compliance auditing and reporting
• Greater transparency monitoring users, applications, and devices

How Does SIEM Work?
SIEM software works by collecting log and event data produced from applications, devices
networks, infrastructure, and systems to draw analysis and provide a holistic 
view of an organization’s information technology (IT).
SIEM solutions can reside either in on-premises or cloud environments. 
Analyzing all of the data in real-time, SIEM solutions use rules and statistical 
correlations to drive actional insight during forensic investigations. SIEM technology
examines all data, sorting threat activity according to its risk level to help security 
teams identify malicious actors and mitigate cyberattacks quickly.
